# Expenses Api

A fully tested stateless API in Rails for keeping of expenses. I am using this api to learn building apps in different frameworks for different devices.
* Versioning and subdomain
* Available resources: users, expenses, categories
* Token based authentication

## Installation

* Clone the repo
* `bundle`
* `rake db:migrate`

## Running the test suite

* `rake db:test:prepare`
* `rspec`
